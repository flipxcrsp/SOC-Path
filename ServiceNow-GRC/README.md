# ðŸ“˜ ServiceNow GRC Training

This repository documents my learning journey with ServiceNow's Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC) platform, starting with the **Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Fundamentals (Xanadu)** course.

As a cybersecurity professional pursuing SOC Analyst and Risk Operations roles, I believe it's important to understand how **security operations align with business governance, regulatory frameworks, and risk mitigation strategies**.

By learning how enterprise GRC platforms function â€” from risk assessments to control frameworks â€” I gain a better understanding of how **security efforts support not only technology, but also the organization's goals, assets, and stakeholders.**
