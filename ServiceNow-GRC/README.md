# ðŸ“˜ ServiceNow GRC Training

This directory documents my learning journey with ServiceNow's **Governance, Risk, and Compliance (GRC)** platform, starting with the **Integrated Risk Management (IRM) Fundamentals (Xanadu)** course.

As a cybersecurity professional pursuing SOC Analyst and Risk Operations roles, I believe it's important to understand how **security operations align with business governance, regulatory frameworks, and risk mitigation strategies**.

By learning how enterprise GRC platforms function â€” from policy lifecycles to control automation and risk scoring â€” Iâ€™ve gained a deeper understanding of how **security efforts support both technical and organizational goals**.
