# Log Analysis

This folder contains artifacts and practical exercises completed as part of Cybrary's **Log Analysis** module under the SOC Analyst Career Path.

These exercises focused on identifying, analyzing, and interpreting logs from Linux systems, often using core utilities like `cat`, `head`, `less`, and `grep` to manually investigate security-relevant events.

## 🧪 What This Includes

- Screenshots from log exploration and filtering exercises
- Terminal outputs from hands-on tasks
- Analysis of `.log` files for suspicious patterns or entries

## 🔍 Sample Activities

- Listing files in the `/var/log/` directory
- Using `cat` and `head` to inspect logs
- Searching for specific keywords in log entries
- Understanding common Linux log files such as:
  - `auth.log`
  - `syslog`
  - `kern.log`

## 📸 Notable Screenshots

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Practice reading system logs from the CLI
- Recognize relevant system and authentication events
- Extract useful indicators from raw log data
