# Wazuh SIEM Lab

This directory contains screenshots and notes from my hands-on work with the **Wazuh Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)** platform through Cybrary‚Äôs training labs.

## üîç Lab Topics Covered

- **Wazuh Interface Overview**
  - Modules: Security Information Management, Auditing, Threat Detection, Regulatory Compliance
- **Security Events Dashboard**
  - Navigating event logs and Lucene-based filtering
  - Sorting and expanding logs for deeper analysis

- **Apache Lucene Syntax**
  - Filtering logs with `key:value`, Boolean logic (AND, OR, NOT)
  - Examples:
    - `rule.description: "User account enabled or created."`
    - `manager.name: ubuntu AND data.win.eventdata.targetUserName: Pikachu`

- **Event Analysis with MITRE ATT&CK**
  - MITRE Technique `T1098`: Persistence via user account creation
  - Associated event logs using Event ID 4720 (Windows account creation)

- **Cross-platform Validation**
  - Viewed and correlated logs in both:
    - **Windows Event Viewer**
    - **Wazuh Web Interface**
  - Confirmed timestamps, usernames, domains, and IPs

- **Custom Filtering**
  - Filtered logs by:
    - Time range (e.g., `Jan 20, 2024 ‚Üí Jan 23, 2024`)
    - Rule ID, rule.level, manager.name
    - Target usernames: `Hermit`, `Joker`, `Chariot`, `Pikachu`

## üß† Skills Practiced

- SIEM navigation and dashboard use
- Lucene/DQL search syntax for log queries
- Log correlation across systems
- MITRE mapping for detection and classification
- Agent service troubleshooting (Wazuh agent restarts, host file updates, IP validation)
