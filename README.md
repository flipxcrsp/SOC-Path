## 🔍 Overview
This repo serves as a central hub for my cybersecurity learning journey, with a focus on skills and tools relevant to working in a Security Operations Center (SOC).

The structure includes:
- 🧠 **HTB Academy** – structured learning paths (Linux, Windows, Networking, etc.)
- 💻 **HTB Machines** – retired boxes, Starting Point, and write-up documentation
- 🧩 **TryHackMe** – room walk-throughs, flags, and tool usage
- 📚 **Cybrary** – course milestones, notes, and examples
