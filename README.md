## 🔍 Overview
This repo serves as a central hub for my cybersecurity learning journey, with a focus on skills and tools relevant to working in a Security Operations Center (SOC).

The structure includes:
- 🧠 **HTB Academy** – SOC Analyst Prerequisites path (Linux, Windows, Bash, Networking, Nmap, etc.)
- 💻 **HTB Machines** – Starting Point and general machine write-ups
- 🧩 **TryHackMe** – room walk-throughs, flags, and tool usage
- 📚 **Cybrary** – SOC Analyst Career Path milestones, notes, and practicals
